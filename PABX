pfSense doesnÂ´t support SIP ALG, so:
Change Firewall to CONSERVATIVE MODE (under System > Advanced, Firewall & NAT Tab)
And set all phones to re-register every 30-60s or if possible to keep-alive option!
That's all. And open the respective ports.
If there is trouble, passthrough to modem.

# Can't upgrade, says it's on older version but up-to-date and status says there is another version!
Like: Sayts 2.7.0 but there is a 2.7.2 version:

ssh to it and:
# certctl rehash

# IP SEC <> OPEN VPN #

So Setup for this example is:
SiteA (192.168.1.0/24)
SiteB (192.168.2.0/24)
OpenVPN is 72.20.50.0/24
SiteA has the OpenVPN setup on it.
SiteA and SiteB both have IPsecVPN setup on them.

You need to add another Phase 2 entry on both sites, and you need to add the SiteB network into the OpenVPN settings.

Open up IPSEC tunnels on SiteA > Copy the Phase 2 entry > Change Local Network dropdown to Network > Add in the IP range that the OpenVPN uses, for ex: 172.20.50.0/24
Rename in Description > Save and Apply.
Open up IPSEC tunnels on SiteB > Copy the Phase 2 entry > Change Remote Network dropdown to Network > Add in the IP that the OpenVPN uses, for ex: 172.20.50.0/24
Rename in Description > Save and Apply
Edit your OpenVPN server > Under IPv4 Local network(s) > Add in the network of SiteB. Separate multiple networks with a , so for example 192.168.1.0/24,192.168.2.0/24
