Save the following XML to /tmp/isolated.xml:

<network>
  <name>isolated</name>
    <ip address='192.168.254.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
    <dhcp>
      <range start='192.168.254.2' end='192.168.254.254' />
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
</network>

Create the network, set it to autostart, and start it:

virsh net-define /tmp/isolated.xml
virsh net-autostart isolated
virsh net-start isolated

Edit (using "virsh edit $guestname") the configuration of each guest that uses direct (macvtap) for its network connection and add a new <interface> in the <devices> section similar to the following:

<interface type='network'>
  <source network='isolated'/>
  <model type='virtio'/> <-- This line is optional.
</interface>

shutdown, then restart each of these guests.
