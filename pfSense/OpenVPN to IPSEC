# IP SEC <> OPEN VPN #

So Setup for this example is:
SiteA (192.168.1.0/24)
SiteB (192.168.2.0/24)
OpenVPN is 72.20.50.0/24
SiteA has the OpenVPN setup on it.
SiteA and SiteB both have IPsecVPN setup on them.

You need to add another Phase 2 entry on both sites, and you need to add the SiteB network into the OpenVPN settings.

Open up IPSEC tunnels on SiteA > Copy the Phase 2 entry > Change Local Network dropdown to Network > Add in the IP range that the OpenVPN uses, for ex: 172.20.50.0/24
Rename in Description > Save and Apply.
Open up IPSEC tunnels on SiteB > Copy the Phase 2 entry > Change Remote Network dropdown to Network > Add in the IP that the OpenVPN uses, for ex: 172.20.50.0/24
Rename in Description > Save and Apply
Edit your OpenVPN server > Under IPv4 Local network(s) > Add in the network of SiteB. Separate multiple networks with a , so for example 192.168.1.0/24,192.168.2.0/24
