pfSense doesnÂ´t support SIP ALG, so:
Change Firewall to CONSERVATIVE MODE (under System > Advanced, Firewall & NAT Tab)
And set all phones to re-register every 30-60s or if possible to keep-alive option!
That's all. And open the respective ports.
If there is trouble, passthrough to modem.

# Can't upgrade, says it's on older version but up-to-date and status says there is another version!
Like: Sayts 2.7.0 but there is a 2.7.2 version:

ssh to it and:
# certctl rehash
