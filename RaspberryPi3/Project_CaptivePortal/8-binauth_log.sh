# This is an example script for BinAuth
# It can set the session duration per client and writes a local log.
#
# It retrieves redir, a variable that either contains the originally requested url
# or a url-encoded or aes-encrypted payload of custom variables sent from FAS or PreAuth.
#
# The client User Agent string is also forwarded to this script.
#
# If BinAuth is enabled, NDS will call this script as soon as it has received an authentication request
# from the web page served to the client's CPD (Captive Portal Detection) Browser by one of the following:
#
# 1. splash.html
# 2. PreAuth
# 3. FAS
#

# Get the current Date/Time for the log
date=$(date)

#
# Get the action method from NDS ie the first command line argument.
#
# Possible values are:
# "auth_client" - NDS requests validation of the client
# "client_auth" - NDS has authorised the client
# "client_deauth" - NDS has deauthorised the client
# "idle_deauth" - NDS has deauthorised the client because the idle timeout duration has been exceeded
# "timeout_deauth" - NDS has deauthorised the client because the session length duration has been exceeded
# "ndsctl_auth" - NDS has authorised the client because of an ndsctl command
# "ndsctl_deauth" - NDS has deauthorised the client because of an ndsctl command
# "shutdown_deauth" - NDS has deauthorised the client because it received a shutdown command
#

       # The redir parameter is sent to this script as the fifth command line argument in url-encoded form.
       #
       # In the case of a simple splash.html login, redir is the URL originally requested by the client CPD.
       #
       # In the case of PreAuth or FAS it MAY contain not only the originally requested URL
       # but also a payload of custom variables defined by Preauth or FAS.
       #
       # It may just be simply url-encoded (fas_secure_enabled 0 and 1), or
       # aes encrypted (fas_secure_enabled 2)
       #
       # The username and password variables may be passed from splash.html, FAS or PreAuth and can be used
       # not just as "username" and "password" but also as general purpose string variables to pass information to BinAuth.
       #
       # The client User Agent string is sent as the sixth command line argument.
       # This can be used to determine much information about the capabilities of the client.
       # In this case it will be added to the log.
       #
       # Both redir and useragent are url-encoded, so decode:
