# EXAMPLE 1
# This is an example script for BinAuth
# It verifies a client username and password and sets the session length.
#
# If BinAuth is enabled, NDS will call this script as soon as it has received an authentication request
# from the web page served to the client's CPD (Captive Portal Detection) Browser by one of the following:
#
# 1. splash_sitewide.html
# 2. PreAuth
# 3. FAS
#
# The username and password entered by the clent user will be included in the query string sent to NDS via html GET
# For an example, see the file splash_sitewide.html
