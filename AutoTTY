# Auto Login when just CLI!

Create:

/etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/override.conf

Content:

[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --noissue --autologin ubuntu %I $TERM
Type=idle

# For ROOT:

[Service]
ExecStart=
ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --noissue --autologin root %I $TERM
Type=idle

The option Type=idle found in the default getty@.service will delay the service startup until all jobs
(state change requests to units) are completed in order to avoid polluting the login prompt with boot-up messages.

To run a program after login on a specific TTY, put on .profile:

if [[ "$(tty)" == "/dev/tty1" ]]
 then
  # do whatever you want here
fi
