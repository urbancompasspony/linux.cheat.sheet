Autohirization and Revocation

Disable the toggle in front of Updater to revoke authorization.
(This will stop the app from collecting data and delete existing related data required for such update from your phone and servers).

Once done, clear the recent apps menu. Now, neither your phone will check for updates nor will you receive any software update notification. 
Unless the authorization is granted back again.

Bonus: You can revoke the authorization, even for System Apps Updater and Get Apps, to stop annoying notifications.
